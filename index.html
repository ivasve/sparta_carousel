        Athletic Club Sparta Praha (Czech pronunciation: [ˈaː ˈt͡sɛː ˈsparta
        ˈpraɦa]), commonly known as Sparta Prague, is a Czech football club
        based in Prague. It is the most successful club in the Czech Republic
        and one of the most successful in central Europe, winning the central
        European Cup (also known as the Mitropa Cup) three times as well as
        having reached the semi-finals of the European Cup (now the UEFA
        Champions League) in 1992 and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1973.[1][2]
        Sparta have won 36 domestic league titles, the Czech Cup (formerly
        Czechoslovak Cup) 27 times, also a record, and the Czech Supercup
        twice.[1] Sparta was long the main source for the Czech Republic
        national football team, however lately this has ceased to be the case,
        as the best Czech players almost exclusively play in foreign leagues.
        Sparta play at Prague's Generali Česká pojišťovna Arena, also known as
        Letná Stadium.
